; Module: test/cases/motions_j-shorter-next-line.asm
; Purpose: AC11 (load-bearing for AC4's column-clamp logic) —
;          verify motion_j clamps the column when the next line
;          is shorter.
;
;          Gap: "hello\nhi" (8 bytes); cursor at 4 ('o' on line
;          0, col 4). Expected: cursor at 7 (the 'i' on line 1,
;          col 1 — clamped from col 4).
;
; AC reference: AC11 (Story 2.5 Sub 7.8).
;
; Sentinel codes at 0xCFFE on failure (TH1):
;   0x80 — cursor_offset != 7
;   0x81 — count_accumulator not cleared
